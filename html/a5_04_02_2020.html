<h1>RAGHU DIXIT!</h1>

The album consists of eight tracks,[5][6] in Kannada, Hindi and Tamil languages. In an interview with Vishnupriya Bhandaram of The Hindu, he mentions, "Every 200 kilometres in this country, languages change, the dialects change and the food changes, lives and lifestyles change and my music is unique and probably the USP is that it's sung in a vernacular tongueâ€¦ its adds mystery."[7]</p>
